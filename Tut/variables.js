// x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;

// x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;

// x, y, and z, are undeclared variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

// If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.
// If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
